## happy-squares

squares to make humble developers happy again. :tomato:

this is a simple project to show git progress (i.e. <insert your color> squares). it builds fast, has no dependencies (so far) and shows what you want and can gaze at. happy using!

### havin':

- node 14.17.0 because I am too lazy

### usage:

The project is in deep alpha so
- clone
- npm link
- use `happysquares` in any git repo

`--l` makes it take local config name

### develop:

`in progress`
